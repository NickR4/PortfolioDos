<h2> Components</h2>
<div class = "container">
  <div class = "logobox">
    <img src = "Images/schedule.png" alt "schedule" class="logo">
    <p> SCHEDULE IT</p>
    <p> First I will create an app for scheduleing a date and time to meet. Which includes a way to send the invitation and an RSVP system for invitees.</p>
  </div> 
<div class = "logobox">
    <img src = "Images/group.png" alt "group" class="logo">
    <p> GROUP IT</p>
     <p>Next I will create an app for groups. People can create, join, and leave groups. The invitations will be sent to all group members, and group members can RSVP creating a live list of who plans to attend.</p>
  </div> 
  <div class = "logobox">
    <img src = "Images/map.png" alt "map" class="logo">
    <p>MAP IT </p>
    <p> Then I will create a map app which sets a marker of where to meet. This should be adjustable and visible to everyone. But it can only be set or modified by the designated leader.</p>
  </div> 

  <div class = "logobox">
    <img src = "Images/combine.png" alt "combine" class="logo">
    <p>COMBINE IT</p>
    <p> Finally, I will combine all three components into one app! So there are groups who can schedule a day, time, and place to meet for a walk together! They can rsvp, but even if they don't they can still show up!""
